Ranya  : Hey, how's it going?

Nizar: Oh, just living the dream. Can't you tell?

Ranya  : Haha, well at least you're keeping your sense of humor. Is everything okay?

Nizar: Well, not really. I found out that I didn't get into my dream college. It's been really tough.

Aymen: Hey, is everything okay here?

Ranya  : Nizar didn't get into their dream college and is feeling pretty down about it.

Aymen: Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?

Nizar: Thank you, it means a lot. I'm just trying to process things right now.

Ranya  : We were just talking about how there are still plenty of great colleges out there and that Nizar will find the right fit.

Aymen: That's true, and you're an amazing student with so much potential. You're going to do great things no matter where you end up.

Nizar: Thank you both, I really appreciate your support. It's just hard to let go of this dream.

Ranya  : We understand, but we're here for you no matter what. Have you talked to anyone at the college about why you didn't get in? Maybe there's something you can do to improve your chances next time.

Nizar: No, I haven't really thought about that. Do you think it's worth it?

Aymen: Absolutely. You have nothing to lose by asking for feedback. It could even help you with your applications to other schools.

Ranya  : And who knows, maybe they'll see how much you really want to attend their college and reconsider their decision.

Nizar: That's a good point. I'll definitely consider reaching out to them.

Aymen: And in the meantime, don't forget to take care of yourself. It's okay to feel disappointed, but make sure you're still taking care of your physical and mental health.

Ranya  : That's right. Maybe you could take a break from thinking about college and do something fun or relaxing.

Nizar: That sounds like a good idea. Maybe I'll take a walk or watch a movie.

Aymen: And remember, we're here for you no matter what. We believe in you and know that you'll find the right path for you.

Ranya  : Absolutely. You're an amazing person with so much to offer. Don't let this setback define you.

Nizar: Thank you all so much. I really appreciate your support and encouragement. I'll keep you updated on how things go.
