This conversation among the three friends highlights the importance of being present and supportive for one another
 during tough times. Friend 2 is going through a difficult experience of not getting into their desired college, 
and their friends respond with empathy and concern. However, Friend 3's distraction by their phone distracts 
from the conversation, leading Friend 1 to remind them to be present and supportive.
 This shows the importance of active listening , being present in the moment and engaging in the conversation
 when someone is sharing their feelings and experiences with you , rather than getting distracted .
 by doing so , we can build stronger connections and have an effective communication
