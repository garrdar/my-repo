Ranya: Hey, how's it going?

Nizar: Oh, just living the dream. Can't you tell?

Ranya: Haha, well at least you're keeping your sense of humor. Is everything okay?

(Aymen nods his head to the beat of the music inside his earphone and sings along with it)

Nizar: Well, not really. I found out that I didn't get into my dream college. It's been really tough.

Ranya: Aymen, is everything okay? We're talking about something important here.

(Aymen looks up from his phone)

Aymen: Oh, sorry about that. I just got distracted for a second. What were you saying?

Ranya: Nizar didn't get into their dream college and is feeling pretty down about it.

Aymen: Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?

Nizar: Thank you, it means a lot. I'm just trying to process things right now.

(Aymen nods his head again to the beat of the music)

Ranya: Aymen, can you please focus on the conversation? We want to be supportive of Nizar.

Aymen: Yeah, sorry about that. I'm here for you, Nizar. It's tough to hear about the college rejection, but I believe in you and know that you'll find the right path.

Nizar: Thank you both, I really appreciate your support. It's just hard to let go of this dream.

(Aymen checks his phone again)

Ranya: Aymen, can you please put your phone away and be present in the conversation? We really need your support here.

Aymen: Yeah, sorry. I'm here for you, Nizar. Don't give up hope. There are still plenty of other great colleges out there.
